- [ ] Using bcmath of PHP to avoid floating-point when calculate numbers
- [ ] Use SensitiveParameterValue to store sensitive data to avoid backtrace to leak sensitive data
- [ ] Ensure that data values are safely passed to JavaScript by using the 'data-' attribute approach to separate concerns and prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
